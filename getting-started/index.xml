      <description>Pick the most suitable instructions for your operating system:
macOS On a Mac you can use brew:
brew tap jenkins-x/jx brew install jx  Or if you have not installed brew and prefer to install by hand:
curl -L https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/releases/download/v1.3.81/jx-darwin-amd64.tar.gz | tar xzv sudo mv jx /usr/local/bin Linux curl -L https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/releases/download/v1.3.81/jx-linux-amd64.tar.gz | tar xzv sudo mv jx /usr/local/bin Other platforms download the binary for jx and add it to your $PATH</description>

      <title>Create new Cluster</title>

      <description>To create a new Kubernetes cluster with Jenkins X installed use the jx create cluster command.
A number of different public cloud providers are supported as shown below.
For the best getting started experience we currently recommend using Google Container Engine (GKE). The Google Cloud Platform offers a $300 free credit if you don&amp;rsquo;t have a Google Cloud account. See https://console.cloud.google.com/freetrial
Here&amp;rsquo;s a little demo showing GKE, AKS and Minikube in parallel.</description>

      <description>The Jenkins X CLI will do the following when installing the Jenkins X platform:
Install Helm Jenkins X will install the helm client - (either helm 2.x or helm 3), if it does not already exist in your command shell path. Helm is used for packaging applications/resources (called charts) on Kubernetes, and is rapidly becoming the defacto standard for doing so.
Helm 2.x normally requires a cluster-side component - called tiller, that Jenkins X CLI will install on your kubernetes cluster for you, if it is not already present.</description>

      <description>OK so you have got the jx CLI and you either
 created a Kubernetes cluster with Jenkins X installed Jenkins X on an existing kubernetes cluster  So whats next?
Well the Developing section contains the next steps you may want to try out, such as
 create a new Spring Boot application and import it into Jenkins X create a new quickstart and import it into Jenkins X import existing source code into Jenkins X browsing for browsing pipelines, builds, apps and activity  You may also want to check out the various demonstrations of what you can do with Jenkins X</description>

toc: true Jenkins X can be installed on 1.8 or later of Kubernetes. The requirements are:
 RBAC is enabled insecure docker registries are enabled. This is so that pipelines can use a docker registry running inside the kubernetes cluster (which typically is not public so no https support).</description>
