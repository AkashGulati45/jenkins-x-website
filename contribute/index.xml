      <description>Jenkins X has two types of API documentation: Kubernetes Custom Resource Documentation and Godoc. Both types are generated from the jx code.
Setup your development environment It&amp;rsquo;s best to make changes to the Jenkins X code on your local machine. Follow the development guide to get set up.
Writing custom resource documentation The custom resource documentation is mostly generated from the comments on the go structs that define the custom resources, with the introductory content and structure injected.</description>

      <description>Create Your Fork It&amp;rsquo;s best to make changes to the Jenkins X docs on your local machine to check for consistent visual styling. Make sure you&amp;rsquo;ve created a fork of jx-docs on GitHub and cloned the repository locally on your machine. For more information, you can see GitHub&amp;rsquo;s documentation on &amp;ldquo;forking&amp;rdquo; or follow along with Jenkins X&amp;rsquo;s development contribution guide.
You can then create a separate branch for your additions.</description>

      <title>Triaging issues</title>

      <description>The main issue tracker for the Jenkins X project is https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/issues. This aims to capture issues, ideas and development work. If in doubt please raise an issue and a Jenkins X team member will look to triage it as soon as possible.
As Jenkins X is using prow from the Kubernetes ecosystem we figured we&amp;rsquo;d take their lead in traiaging a large number of issues to aid and encourage contributions.</description>
