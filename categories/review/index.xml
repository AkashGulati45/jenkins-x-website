      <description>The pull request is the main place we gate changes in Jenkins X. It&amp;rsquo;s here we:
 run the tests (make test-slow-integration) execute end to end tests against static jenkins and Tekton check the change for linting issues check the code for formatting issues validate that all generated code (mocks, kubernetes clients, kubernetes openapi structs) are up to date validate that we can generate the apidoc validate that your commits are conventional  Our philosophy is to automate the checks as much as possible - there are some that must still be done by a human but we plan to reduce those as far as possible.</description>
