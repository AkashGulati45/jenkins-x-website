      <description>Changes for April 27 2018 Its 16 days since our last blog post and we&amp;rsquo;ve been really busy again!
Here&amp;rsquo;s some of the main highlights:
 we have moved to using skaffold for building docker images so that we can easily take advantage of things like Google Container Builder or kaniko new DevPods are a thing; making it easy to use your kubernetes cluster for building, testing and running apps new integration with Anchore for security scanning via jx get cve or in a pipeline you can use jx step post build - we&amp;rsquo;ll blog separately about that next week thanks to the work of @LinuxSuRen we now have the initial Chinese translation of the Jenkins X documentation we now support MiniShift as well as AKS, AWS, GKE and vanilla kubernetes clusters.</description>

      <description>Changes for April 11 2018 We announced Jenkins X a mere 23 days ago and the feedback has been truly humbling. Thank you all for the awesome feedback!
We&amp;rsquo;ve made a lot of progress and improvements! The rest of the blog goes into more detail.
But first I&amp;rsquo;d like to call out a few specific details from the Roadmap:
 we now fully support GitHub and GitHub enterprise. BitBucket cloud and gitea is almost there too.</description>
