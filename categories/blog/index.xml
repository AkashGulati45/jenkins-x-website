      <description>Changes for April 27 2018 Its 16 days since our last blog post and we&amp;rsquo;ve been really busy again!

 we have moved to using skaffold for building docker images so that we can easily take advantage of things like Google Container Builder or kaniko new DevPods are a thing; making it easy to use your kubernetes cluster for building, testing and running apps new integration with Anchore for security scanning via jx get cve or in a pipeline you can use jx step post build - we&amp;rsquo;ll blog separately about that next week thanks to the work of @LinuxSuRen we now have the initial Chinese translation of the Jenkins X documentation we now support MiniShift as well as AKS, AWS, GKE and vanilla kubernetes clusters.</description>
