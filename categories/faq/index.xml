      <description>We have tried to collate common issues here with work arounds. If your issue isn&amp;rsquo;t listed here please let us know.
Is Jenkins X Open Source? Yes! All of Jenkins X source code and artifacts are open source; either Apache or MIT and will always remain so!
Is Jenkins X a fork of Jenkins? No! Jenkins X will always reuse whatever is in Jenkins Core and configure it to be as kubernetes native as possible.</description>

      <description>What is Helm? helm is the open source package manager for Kubernetes.
It works like other package mangers (brew, yum, npm etc) where there&amp;rsquo;s one or more repositories with packages to install (called charts in helm to keep with the nautical kubernetes theme) which can be searched/installed and upgraded.
A helm chart is basically a versioned tarball of kubernetes yaml which can be easily installed on any kubnernetes cluster.</description>
