      <description>The main issue tracker for the Jenkins X project is https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/issues. This aims to capture issues, ideas and development work. If in doubt please raise an issue and a Jenkins X committer will look to triage it as soon as possible.
As Jenkins X is using prow from the Kubernetes ecosystem we figured we&amp;rsquo;d take their lead in traiaging a large number of issues to aid and encourage contributions. We are resing the style of labels including colours in an attempt to create familiarity across open source projects.</description>
