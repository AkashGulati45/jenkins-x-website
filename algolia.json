相对于行业平均水平——每周一次和每月一次来说，高效的团队应该有能力每天部署多次。\n代码从已提交到上生产应该少于一个小时，变更失败率也应该小于15%，而平均值在31-45%之间。\n从失败中的平均恢复时间应该少于一个小时。\nJenkins X 设计了第一原则，允许团队采用 DevOps 的最佳实践，来达到行业的最高目标。\n实践 下列最佳实践被认为是DevOps成功的关键：\n 架构松耦合 自服务配置 自动化管理 持续构建 / 集成和部署 自动发布管理 增量测试 配置即代码  Jenkins X 把大量常见的方法论和组件集成为复杂度最小的方法。\n架构 Jenkins X 基于松耦合架构的 DevOps 模型，被设计用来支持在多个团队之间，部署大量可重复、可管理的分布式微服务。\n概念模型 构成 Jenkins X 基于以下的核心组件：\nKubernetes 和 Docker Kubernetes 是系统的核心，它已经成为了 DevOps 事实上的虚拟基础设施平台。每个主要的云服务商现在都已经提供了 Kubernetes 基础设施，并且可能已经在很多私有基础设施中也被安装了。测试环境可能也在使用 Minikube 安装器创建本地开发环境。\n从功能上，该Kubernetes 平台扩展了 Docker

中是申明式的，因此，用户指定特定版本的 Pod 中部署的实例数量，Kubernetes 据此来计算跨节点中的 Pod 是应该删除或部署。根据标签匹配来决定资源的实例数量。一旦被部署，Kubernetes 就会通过定期的健康检查来保证 Pod 的数量，终止或则替换没响应的
