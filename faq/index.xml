      <description>We have tried to collate common issues here with work arounds. If your issue isn&amp;rsquo;t listed here please let us know.
Is Jenkins X Open Source? Yes! All of Jenkins X source code and artifacts are open source; either Apache or MIT and will always remain so!
Is Jenkins X a fork of Jenkins? No! Jenkins X currently reuses Jenkins Core and configures it to be as kubernetes native as possible.</description>

      <description>What is Helm? helm is the open source package manager for Kubernetes.
It works like other package mangers (brew, yum, npm etc) where there&amp;rsquo;s one or more repositories with packages to install (called charts in helm to keep with the nautical kubernetes theme) which can be searched/installed and upgraded.
A helm chart is basically a versioned tarball of kubernetes yaml which can be easily installed on any kubnernetes cluster.</description>

      <description>How do I inject environment specific configuration? Each environment in Jenkins X is defined in a git repository; we use GitOps to manage all changes in each environment such as:
 adding/removing apps changing the version of an app (up or down) configuring any app with environment specific values   The first two items are defined in the env/requirements.yaml file in the git repository for your environment. the latter is defined in the env/values.</description>

http: server gave HTTP response to HTTPS client If your pipeline fails with something like this:
The push refers to a repository [100.71.203.90:5000/lgil3/jx-test-app] time=&amp;quot;2018-07-09T21:18:31Z&amp;quot; level=fatal msg=&amp;quot;build step: pushing [100.71.203.90:5000/lgil3/jx-test-app:0.0.2]: Get https://100.71.203.90:5000/v1/_ping: http: server gave HTTP response to HTTPS client&amp;quot;  Then this means that you are using the internal docker registry inside Jenkins X for your images but your kubernetes cluster&amp;rsquo;s docker daemons has not been configured for insecure-registries so that you can use http to talk to the docker registry service jenkins-x-docker-registry in your cluster.</description>
